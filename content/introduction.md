## CorpsMap

Welcome to the CorpsMap developer docs.  This page is primarily targeted to developers who want to use the CorpsMap platform to create their own mapping application.  

The platform includes:

* [corpsmap-xenon.js](#corpsmap-xenon)

  Client-side mapping library based on React.js / OpenLayers3 / Cesium.js with a plugin architecture for development of new capabilities.

* corpsmap-argon.js
* CorpsMap Metadata API
* CorpsMap Data API

The documentation here is divided roughly in those categories and gives examples of how to use each of the API components.  You should find all the information you need below to get started using the CorpsMap platform for your own projects, the team is also available over slack at [corpsmap-slack.com](https://corpsmap.slack.com) if you have any questions.
